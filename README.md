# Ethereu-Blockchain-Explorer-FYP
Final Year Project - Ethereum blockchain explorer. READ README!

To fully function this program needs to have a CSV of Ethereum Price in the project directory.
This is for the creation of a 30 price history chart of ETH, displayed in the application.

Due to the nature of the Ethereum blockchain constantly expanding in size (TB's), without a dedicated machine running an ETH node, full ETH address transaction history will not be available. For demonstration purposes a database file named 'eth_database' is used, containing the transaction history of all addresses from the first week of 2020. These are the only addresses that will successfully return data when queried.
